@date 		8/30/17
@rel		3


@section 	Summary
	Revision numbering is used throughout the entire product cycle, including conceptualization, prototype, development, productization & release

@section 	Numbering Schema (numeric)
	X.Y.Z
		X - Major
		Y - Minor
		Z - Revision

@section 	Example
	@note In communication the numbering schema used is decided at the time of use, e.g. -
		- 'DTECTS 1'     targets this market 
		- 'DTECTS 1.2'   enables this feature
		- 'DTECTS 1.2.5' fixes this bug

@section 	Notes
	Product Naming is independent of the revision numbering. Revision numbering is primarily an internal tool, and may be used externally when needed.
